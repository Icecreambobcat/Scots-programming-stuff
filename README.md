# Welcome
If you're reading this, you're probably my teacher, but if you're not, you're probably Alex Xie.
This is a compilation of all projects that I will create during my time at Scots.
The directories can all be found in the relevant folders since creating new repos for every single thing is annoyng and I'm so not bothered to actually do it.
# Directories
## Assessments
- Y9T2 Attempt 2
    - Assets (surely I don't need to tell you what these are)
        - Too many to list
    - main.py (mainframe)
    - mapdata.py (level data array)
## Not assessments
- Random stuff that I mess around with. Don't expect anything good here if anything at all
